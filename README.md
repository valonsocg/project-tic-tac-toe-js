# Tic-Tac-Toe Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up your Tic-Tac-Toe project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and get your Git repository ready.

## Project Overview

### 🗂️ Project Structure

1. **Set Up Project Structure**

   - **HTML**: Create an `index.html` file.
   - **CSS**: Create a `styles.css` file.
   - **JavaScript**: Create a `script.js` file.
   - **Git**: Initialize a Git repository.

2. **📋 Gameboard Object**

   - Store the gameboard as an array inside a `Gameboard` object.

3. **👤 Player Objects**

   - Create player objects to manage player information.

4. **🔄 Game Logic**

   - Control the flow of the game with a `GameController` object.

5. **🛠️ Modular Design**
   - Minimize global code by using factories and IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).

## Setup Steps

### 1. Initialize Your Project

- **🗂️ Create Your Files**: Set up your project with the following files:

  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `script.js`

- **🌟 Initialize Git**: Run `git init` to start version control for your project.

### 2. Develop Your Game Logic

- **🎮 Gameboard Object**:

  - Create a `Gameboard` object to store the game state as an array.
  - Implement methods to render and update the gameboard.

- **👥 Player Objects**:

  - Use a factory function to create player objects with names and marks.

- **🕹️ Game Controller**:

  - Implement a `GameController` object to manage game state, player turns, and game logic.

- **📜 Display Controller**:
  - Develop a `DisplayController` object to manage the DOM updates and display messages.

### 3. Focus on Functionality First

- **🔍 Console Testing**:

  - Ensure that the game logic works correctly in the console before adding UI elements.

- **🌐 Render to Webpage**:

  - Implement functions to render the gameboard and handle user interactions via the DOM.

- **🎨 User Interface**:
  - Add input fields for player names, buttons to start and reset the game, and a display area for game results.

## Design Considerations

- **📦 Minimize Global Code**:

  - Use modular design principles to encapsulate functionality within objects and avoid global variables.

- **🔄 Logical Organization**:
  - Place functionality in the appropriate objects (e.g., game logic in `GameController`, display logic in `DisplayController`).
